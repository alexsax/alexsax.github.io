We propose a broadly applicable and fully computational method for augmenting learning with Cross-Task Consistency. The proposed formulation is based on inference-path invariance over a graph of arbitrary tasks. We observe that learning with cross-task consistency leads to more accurate predictions and better generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. This framework also leads to an informative unsupervised quantity, called Consistency Energy, based on measuring the intrinsic consistency of the system. Consistency Energy correlates well with the supervised error (r=0.67), thus it can be employed as an unsupervised confidence metric as well as for detection of out-of-distribution inputs (ROC-AUC=0.95). The evaluations are performed on multiple datasets, including Taskonomy, Replica, CocoDoom, and ApolloScape, and they benchmark cross-task consistency versus various baselines including conventional multi-task learning, cycle consistency, and analytical consistency.","tags":["Robustness"],"title":"Robust Learning Through Cross-Task Consistency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Sax","Jeffrey O.

We study this question by integrating a generic perceptual skill set (e.g. a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning framework--see Figure 1. This skill set (hereafter **mid-level perception**) provides the policy with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images.  We find that using a mid-level perception confers significant advantages over training end-to-end from scratch (i.e. not leveraging priors) in navigation-oriented tasks. Agents are able to generalize to situations where the from-scratch approach fails and training becomes significantly more sample efficient. However, we show that realizing these gains requires careful selection of the mid-level perceptual skills. Therefore, we refine our findings into an efficient max-coverage feature set that can be adopted in lieu of raw images. We perform our study in completely separate buildings for training and testing and compare against visually blind baseline policies and state-of-the-art feature learning methods.","tags":["Robustness"],"title":"Mid-Level Visual Priors Improve Generalization and Sample Efficiency for Learning Visuomotor Policies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fei Xia*","Zhiyang He*","Amir Zamir*","Alexander Sax","Jitendra Malik","Silvio Savarese"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Learning active perception and sensorimotor control in the physical world is cumbersome as existing algorithms are too slow to efficiently learn in real-time and robots are fragile and costly. This has given rise to learning in simulation which consequently casts a question on transferring to real-world. In this paper, we study learning **perception** for **active agents** in **real-world**, propose a virtual environment for this purpose, and demonstrate complex learned locomotion abilities. The primary characteristics of the learning environments, which transfer into the trained agents, are I) being from the real-world and reflecting its semantic complexity, II) having a mechanism to ensure no need to further domain adaptation prior to deployment of results in real-world, III) embodiment of the agent and making it subject to constraints of space and physics.","tags":["Robustness"],"title":"GibsonEnv: Embodied Real-World Active Perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amir Zamir","Alexander Sax*","William B.

However, a proper model is needed for the structure to be actionable, e.g., to reduce the supervision required by utilizing task relationships. We therefore ask: which tasks transfer to an arbitrary target task, and how well? Or, how do we learn a set of tasks collectively, with less total supervision? These are some of the questions that can be answered by a computational model of the vision tasks space, as proposed in this paper. We explore the task structure utilizing a sampled dictionary of 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks, and modeling their (1st and higher order) transfer behaviors in a latent space. The product can be viewed as a computational task taxonomy (Taskonomy) and a map of the task space. We study the consequences of this structure, e.g., the emerging task relationships, and exploit them to reduce supervision demand. For instance, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed to solve a set of 10 tasks can be reduced to 1/4 while keeping performance nearly the same by using features from multiple proxy tasks. Users can employ a provided Binary Integer Programming solver that leverages the taxonomy to find efficient supervision policies for their own use cases.","tags":["Transfer Learning"],"title":"Taskonomy: Disentangling Task Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Sax*","Iro Armeni*","Amir Zamir","Jitendra Malik","Leonidas Guibas","Silvio Savarese"],"categories":null,"content":"The dataset is available using the links above.
