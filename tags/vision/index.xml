      <description>FMRI images of the brain reveal that there is significant neuronal clustering of activations. It is believed that these correlated activations indicate areas of the brain with functional specificity. These areas function at various levels of abstraction, from low-level sensorimotor tasks, to mid-level identification of faces, and even very abstract things such as thinking about another&amp;rsquo;s thoughts [2]. The brain has specific activation patterns in response to different visual inputs, and the object being viewed can be decoded from these patterns [3].</description>
