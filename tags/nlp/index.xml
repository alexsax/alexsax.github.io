      <description>Toxic comments are increasingly drowning out constructive ones, and websites are reacting by shutting down comment sections. Human moderation is slow and expensive, so an algorithmic solution would be preferable. In this project, we explore the problem, existing literature, and recurrent models that have not yet been applied to this task.
Character LSTMs offer a robust solution because they capture semantics while being robust to typos and intentional obfuscations. Because of this, they hold a significant advantage over common filtering tequniques such as wordlists.</description>

      <description>Effective text summarization has the potential to allow people to process more information. To further this goal, we present multiple extractive baselines on the NYT dataset, which is a large dataset that immediately yields real-life applications. These baselines combine state-of-the-art techniques from many different sources and provide a solid starting point for further work using this hitherto untapped resource.</description>
